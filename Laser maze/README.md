# Welcome to **_LASER MAZE_**


## Description 

Firstly you will be prompted to input _col_ and _row_ for the size of your maze. **Be careful** not to make it to big or else it will not 
show correctly because it depends on the size of your terminal.  
Now you can putdown the mirrors "/" "\\", **you can also undo them** if you've made a mistake by typing in the same coordinates and any mirror you wish.  
When you think you've cracked the maze just type **fire**
